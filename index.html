  <p>To create a parametric equation that passes through a set of three defined points, you can follow these steps:</p>

<p>Let's assume the three points are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3).</p>

<p>Step 1: Define the parameter variable.</p>

<p>Let's use t as the parameter variable.</p>
Step 2: Determine the x-coordinate equation.</p>

<p>You can use the form: x = At^2 + Bt + C, where A, B, and C are constants to be determined.</p>

<p>Plug in the x-coordinates of the three points and solve the resulting system of equations to find A, B, and C.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>When t = 0, x = x1:</p>
<p>x1 = A(0)^2 + B(0) + C</p>
<p>C = x1</p>

<p>When t = 1, x = x2:</p>
<p>x2 = A(1)^2 + B(1) + C</p>
<p>A + B + C = x2 - x1</p>

<p>When t = 2, x = x3:</p>
<p>x3 = A(2)^2 + B(2) + C</p>
<p>4A + 2B + C = x3 - x1</p>

<p>Solve the system of equations to find the values of A, B, and C.</p>

<p>Step 3: Determine the y-coordinate equation.</p>

<p>Use the form: y = Dt^2 + Et + F, where D, E, and F are constants to be determined.</p>

<p>Plug in the y-coordinates of the three points and solve the resulting system of equations to find D, E, and F.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>When t = 0, y = y1:</p>
<p>y1 = D(0)^2 + E(0) + F</p>
<p>F = y1</p>

<p>When t = 1, y = y2:</p>
<p>y2 = D(1)^2 + E(1) + F</p>
<p>D + E + F = y2 - y1</p>

<p>When t = 2, y = y3:</p>
<p>y3 = D(2)^2 + E(2) + F</p>
<p>4D + 2E + F = y3 - y1</p>

<p>Solve the system of equations to find the values of D, E, and F.</p>

<p>Step 4: Combine the x-coordinate equation and the y-coordinate equation.</p>

<p>The resulting parametric equations will be: </p>
  <p>x = At^2 + Bt + C</p>
<p>y = Dt^2 + Et + F</p>
<p>By following these steps and solving the system of equations, you can obtain a parametric equation that passes through the three defined points.</p>
